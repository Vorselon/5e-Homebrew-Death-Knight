## Runic Power
Starting at 2nd level, you gain access the energy of undeath, Runic Power. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of Runic Power points. Your Death Knight level determines your maximum number of Runic Power points as shown in the Runic Power table (starts with 4 at level 2 and increases by 2 per level taken in Death Knight).

You can spend these points to fuel various Runic Power features. You start knowing 3 such features: Death Grip, Blood Boil, and Anti-magic shell.

When you spend Runic Power, it is unavailable until you finish a long rest, at the end of which you re-empower yourself.

If there are multiple options for empowering an ability, you can only choose one per use of the ability.
